- **Structured logging** - Color-coded log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR) with component identification
- **Real-time updates** - Live application status, configuration, and request/response logs
- **Scrollable history** - Navigate through log history with automatic retention management

### Right Pane: Request Monitor
- Latest HTTP request details with full context
- Request method, URL, path, and status code
- Response timing and size information
- Complete request and response headers
- Request body content (for POST/PUT requests)
- Color-coded status indicators and error highlighting

### Enhanced Features
- **Smart port allocation** - Automatic selection of available ports for reliability
- **Service URL display** - Shows all access URLs (internet, tailnet, local, UI)
- **Readiness checks** - Waits for services to be fully ready before displaying URLs
- **Clean shutdown** - Automatic cleanup of Tailscale serve configuration on exit

### Controls
- `q` or `Ctrl+C` to quit (with automatic cleanup)

- Up/Down arrows to scroll through content

## üîß Configuration

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Tailscale** on your machine:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install tailscale
   
   # Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
   curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
   
   # Windows
   # Download from https://tailscale.com/download
   ```

2. **Authenticate with Tailscale**:
   ```bash
   sudo tailscale up
   ```

3. **Enable HTTPS certificates** (for --funnel or --use-https):
   - Go to https://login.tailscale.com/admin/dns
   - Enable "HTTPS Certificates"
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for certificate provisioning

### Operating Modes

#### Proxy Mode (Default)
Forwards requests to a local server:
```bash
tgate 8080 --funnel
```

#### Mock Mode
Creates a mock server for testing:
```bash
# Mock mode (auto-enables funnel)
tgate --mock
```

#### Local Tailscale Mode
Uses your existing Tailscale installation:
```bash
tgate 8080 --funnel
```

#### TSNet Mode
Creates a separate Tailscale device:
```bash
# Interactive authentication
tgate 8080 --force-tsnet

# With auth key
tgate 8080 --auth-key tskey-auth-xxxxx
```

## üåç Tailscale Funnel

Tailscale Funnel allows you to expose services to the public internet with automatic configuration:

```bash
# Enable funnel (automatically configures HTTPS on port 443)
tgate 8080 --funnel

# Mock mode automatically enables funnel with optimal settings
tgate --mock
```

**Requirements:**
- HTTPS certificates enabled in Tailscale admin console
- Valid Tailscale subscription with Funnel access
- **Automatic configuration**: TGate automatically:
  - Enables HTTPS when funnel is requested
  - Configures port 443 for funnel traffic
  - Sets up proper certificate handling
  - Manages Tailscale serve configuration

**Auto-Configuration Benefits:**
- No manual port configuration needed
- Automatic HTTPS certificate setup
- Proper funnel/serve configuration management
- Clean shutdown with configuration cleanup

## üìù Logging

### Unified Logging Architecture
TGate uses structured logging with consistent formatting across all components:
- **Proxy server logs** - HTTP request/response details with method, path, and remote address
- **Application logs** - Startup, configuration, and status information
- **Tailscale logs** - Connection status and certificate management
- **All logs** use the same timestamp format and log level indicators

### TUI Mode (Default)
- **Split-pane interface** with real-time visual updates
- **Unified log formatting** - All components log with consistent timestamp/level format
- **Color-coded information** with component identification
- **Automatic retention** - Maintains history of recent requests and logs
- **Request/response tracking** - Full HTTP transaction logging in the application logs pane

### Console Mode
```bash
# Use traditional console output with structured logging
tgate 8080 --no-tui
```

### File Logging
```bash
# Write all logs to file with structured format
tgate 8080 --log-file /tmp/tgate.log
```

### JSON Format
```bash
# Structured JSON output for log analysis tools
tgate 8080 --json --log-file /tmp/tgate.json
```

### Enhanced Logging Features
- **Structured fields** - Consistent log field names across components
- **Component identification** - Clear source identification for each log entry
- **Request correlation** - HTTP requests appear in main application logs
- **Error context** - Enhanced error messages with actionable information

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues
```bash
# Verify installation
tgate --version

# Check if Tailscale is installed and running
tailscale status

# Test with mock mode first (simplest setup)
tgate --mock
```

### TUI Issues
```bash
# Use console mode if TUI has display problems
tgate 8080 --no-tui --funnel

# Enable verbose logging for debugging
tgate 8080 --no-tui --verbose
```

### HTTPS Certificate Issues
```bash
# Check if HTTPS is enabled in Tailscale admin console
# Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling certificates in admin console

# Test HTTP first to verify connectivity
tgate 8080  # Without --funnel or --use-https

# For funnel, certificates are configured automatically
tgate 8080 --funnel --verbose

# Mock mode handles all certificate setup automatically
tgate --mock --verbose
```

### Port and Configuration Issues
```bash
# Clean up any existing Tailscale serve configuration
tgate --cleanup-serve

# Use mock mode which handles all configuration automatically
tgate --mock

# For proxy mode, verify local service is running first
curl localhost:8080
tgate 8080 --verbose
```

### Connection and Network Issues
```bash
# Check Tailscale connection status
tailscale status

# Verify local service is accessible
curl localhost:8080  # Replace with your port

# Test with minimal configuration first
tgate 8080 --verbose

# Use mock mode to isolate networking issues
tgate --mock --verbose

# Check logs for detailed error information
tgate 8080 --no-tui --verbose --log-file /tmp/tgate.log
```

### Cleanup and Reset
```bash
# Clean up Tailscale serve configuration
tgate --cleanup-serve

# Reset Tailscale serve (alternative method)
tailscale serve reset

# Restart with fresh configuration
tgate --mock --verbose
```
