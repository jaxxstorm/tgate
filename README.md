## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues
```bash
# Verify installation
tgate --version

# Check if Tailscale is installed and running
tailscale status
```

### TUI Hangs or Doesn't Display
```bash
# Use console mode instead
tgate 8080 --no-tui --funnel
```

# Check if HTTPS is enabled in Tailscale admin
# Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling certificates
# Try HTTP first to test connectivity
tgate 8080  # Without --funnel or --use-https
```

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Reset Tailscale serve configuration
tailscale serve reset

# Or use a different serve port
tgate 8080 --serve-port 8443
```

### Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify local service is running
curl localhost:8080

# Check Tailscale status
tailscale status

# Enable verbose logging
tgate 8080 --verbose
```
